# cfSNV Docker

## Overview

`cfSNV` is an ultra-sensitive and accurate somatic SNV caller designed for cfDNA sequencing. Taking advantage of modern statistical models and machine learning approaches, `cfSNV` provides hierarchical mutation profiling and multi-layer error suppression, including error suppression in read mates, site-level error filtration and read-level error filtration.

Here we present a Docker image of the `cfSNV` package, which is designed such that researchers and clinicians with a limited computational background can easily carry out analyses on both high-performance computing platforms and local computers.

`cfSNV Docker` can be freely used for educational and research purposes by non-profit institutions and U.S. government agencies only under the UCLA Academic Software License. For information on the use for a commercial purpose or by a commercial or for-profit entity, please contact Prof. Xianghong Jasmine Zhou (XJZhou@mednet.ucla.edu) and Prof. Wenyuan Li (WenyuanLi@mednet.ucla.edu).

## Equipment setup

The Docker container can be built and run on most operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, or Linux.

#### 1. Install Docker

Get Docker from https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.

#### 2. Download cfSNV Docker image

Download our latest `cfsnv_image.tar.gz` from https://github.com/jasminezhoulab/cfSNV_docker/releases. Save the docker image to your `working_directory`.

#### 3. Load cfSNV Docker image

After starting the Docker software and enter the `working_directory`, type the following command in Unix Terminal or Windows Command Prompt:

```bash
docker load < cfsnv_image.tar.gz
```

The Docker image called `cfsnv_docker` will be loaded. 

#### 4. Create cfSNV Docker container and mount data directory

Users need to specify two directory paths for mounting: (1) a local directory called `local_directory` on the host machine, where all input data are located, and (2) a container directory called `container_directory`, through which the data on the host machine can be accessed in the container. Type the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -d -v <local_directory>:<container_directory> --name <cfsnv_container> cfsnv_docker bash
```

In this command, please replace `<local_directory>` with a local directory in the host machine (e.g., C:\Documents\cfSNV\demo for Windows and /home/users/cfSNV/demo for Unix), and replace `<container_directory>` with the directory in the docker (a path name in Linux, e.g. /home/cfSNV/demo), and replace `<cfsnv_container>` with a name as the container's name.

#### 5. Run cfSNV Docker container

Then, execute the following line to start the container:

```bash
docker exec -it <cfsnv_container> bash
```

#### Tips

1. If users want to remove the existing container and create a new one with the same name, execute:

   ```bash
   docker rm -f <cfsnv_container>
   ```

   where `<cfsnv_container>` is the existing container's name. Then repeat step 4 and 5.
2. If we release a new Docker image version, users should first remove or rename the old Docker image, then download and load the new image.


## Pipeline

There are three main modules in the `cfSNV Docker` package: preprocessing, parameter recommendation, and mutation detection.

![cfSNV_pipeline](./pic/cfSNV_pipeline.jpg)

The detailed usage of each function can be found using flag `-h` (help). For example, to check how to use `DetectMuts`, type the following command in the container directory `/home/cfSNV`:

```
./DetectMuts -h
```

which will return:

```bash
This function outputs the variant list to a VCF file and writes the tumor fraction to a TXT file.

Usage: ./DetectMuts -p ${plasma} -n ${normal} -e ${extended} -u ${uncombined} -t ${target} -g ${genome} -d ${database} -i ${id} -mh ${minHold} -mp ${minPass} -o ${output}
	-p|--plasma a BAM file of the cfDNA sequencing data
	-n|--normal a BAM file of the normal sample sequencing data
	-e|--extended a BAM file of the combined cfDNA reads
	-u|--uncombined a BAM file of the cfDNA reads that are not combined
	-t|--target a BED file of target regions
	-g|--genome a FASTA file of the reference genome
	-d|--database a VCF file of the positions that are blocked from mutation calling, e.g. a common SNP database
	-i|--id a sample ID name
	-mh|--minHold a minimum number of supporting read pairs that are required for mutations in the HOLD category. Default is 12
	-mp|--minPass a minimum number of supporting read pairs that are required for mutations in the PASS category. Default is 5
	-o|--output an output directory for the variant list
```

## Example data and test demo data

**Example data files**

The example data can be downloaded by executing the script `DownloadEg` or through:

```bash
wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR850/ERR850376/ERR850376_1.fastq.gz
wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR850/ERR850376/ERR850376_2.fastq.gz

wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR852/ERR852106/ERR852106_1.fastq.gz
wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR852/ERR852106/ERR852106_2.fastq.gz
```

The example reference files can be downloaded through

```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/record/6450376/files/example_reference_files.tar.gz
```

**Test demo data files**

The demo data for quick testing can be downloaded through

```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/record/6450376/files/demo_data.tar.gz
```

The demo reference files can be downloaded through

```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/record/6450376/files/demo_reference_files.tar.gz
```

## The demo output

The output of running `RecParams` on the demo data:

```bash
Sample ID: demo_cfDNA

The per base coverage of the plasma sample for each genomic region in the target bed file:
average = 149.833, median = 139.046, 95th percentile = 280.356 

The roughly estimated tumor fraction in the plasma sample: 10.025% 
For a more accurate estimation, please run DetectMuts. 

Lowest detectable VAF range under the default parameters: [1.783%, 4.28%] 

To detect different levels of lowest VAF, 
at 1% VAF: MIN_HOLD_SUPPORT_COUNT = 9, MIN_PASS_SUPPORT_COUNT = 3; 
at 5% VAF: MIN_HOLD_SUPPORT_COUNT = 20, MIN_PASS_SUPPORT_COUNT = 14 
Note: decreasing the parameters (i.e. MIN_HOLD_SUPPORT_COUNT and MIN_PASS_SUPPORT_COUNT) 
can lower the detection limit, but may also lower the variant quality.
```

The output of running `DetectMuts` on the demo data, including the `${id}.tumor_fraction.txt` file:

```bash
demo_cfDNA tumor fraction: 10.4117553285%
```

and the `${id}.variant_list.vcf` file:
